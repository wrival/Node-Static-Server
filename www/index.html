	<p>
		This node.js module only fulfills requests that 
		have a matching file in the "www" folder. This 
		means that all the app's code and content are 
		private by default so there is no need for 
		any additional tests to protect private content. 
		Nor is there a need for a seperate "private" error. 
		It also means that things like the header and 
		footer don't even need to be public since they are 
		hardcoded to load from elsewhere and are inserted 
		into the request as needed.
